Alhamdulillah. I’m excited to share that I’ve begun my **Master of Applied Science (MASc)** in **Quality Systems Engineering** at **Concordia University, Montréal**.

This next chapter marks a big step forward in my academic and research journey. Over the past few years, I've been teaching AI and ML as a lecturer at BRAC University. Now, I’m excited to continue developing this expertise in a research environment that encourages both **theoretical depth** and **practical impact**.

At Concordia, I’ll be working on projects that explore:

* 🔍 **Advanced sequence modeling** for complex, real-world datasets.
* 🧩 **New architectures** for representation learning and forecasting.
* 💡 The balance between **interpretability and performance** in modern neural networks.

I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to grow here — surrounded by inspiring researchers, supportive mentors, and a vibrant academic community in Montréal.

This program is not just about taking courses; it’s about contributing to the broader conversation in machine learning, publishing impactful research, and preparing for the challenges ahead in academia.
