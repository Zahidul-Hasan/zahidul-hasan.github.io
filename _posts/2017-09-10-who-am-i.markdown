I am a <span style="color:blue;">lecturer</span> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <span style="color:blue;">BRAC University, Bangladesh</span>. Before that I used to be a <span style = "color:blue;">software engineer</span> at <span style = "color:blue;">Samsung R&D Institude, Bangladesh</span>. I have graduated from the Department of Computer Science of <span style="color:blue;">Dhaka University, Bangladesh</span>. In a past life, I had the good fortune of representing my country in the <span style="color:blue;">International Mathematical Olympiad in 2013</span> and won an honorable mention. I also won a Bronze Medal at the <span style="color:blue;">Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad, 2013</span>. I was announced to be the <span style="color:blue;">National Champion of the Champions</span> by Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee in 2011. I am also responsible for the training of <span style = "color:blue;">BRAC University Programming Contest Community</span> and <span style = "color:blue;">Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Camps</span>.

Besides teaching, I spend my time in <span style="color:blue;">research, reading books, digital illustrations and programming</span>. My areas of interest in research are <span style="color:blue;">Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Theory</span>. Currently, I am working on the <span style="color:blue;">Contextual Bandit</span> problem in adversarial nonstationary environments. My research interests also span <span style="color:blue;">Representation Learning</span> topics such as <span style="color:blue;">Graph Representation Learning</span>.

I am a student for life. I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I love to read about <span style="color:blue;">mathematics, CS, history, mythology, religion, history of religions, anthropology, philology, philosophy, fantasy novels, science fictions</span>. I also love travelling to foreign places. I love nature and animals. I endorse open-mindedness and tolerance.
